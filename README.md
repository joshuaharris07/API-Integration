# API-Integration

Description:
This web application pulls from the API pokeapi.co/api/v2. All of the fetch requests in the Javascript go through that site.

The application starts with a carousel of the starter pokemon for Generation I. If you want to change it to have other pokemon you can change or add to it on the index-script.js file. There is a navbar at the top of the page for navigating between the three pages. Under Pokemon Search, users can search for pokemon by name or by their ID number. If the search is valid, the page will update to dipslay the pokemon's image, name, ID, type, abilities, and stats. Underthe Pokemon Generations page, users can select any of the nine current pokemon generations. Upon selection, the webpage will begin loading the pokemon information for that generation and then will display it, sorted by the pokemon's ID, with the pokemon's image, name, and ID. If the user selects a different generation, the display will clear and load the new generation.

Be sure that all of the files are saved in the same directory so they don't have issues connecting.
